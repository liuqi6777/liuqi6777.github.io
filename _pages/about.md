# About

My name is Qi Liu. I am now a senior-year undergraduate student of [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn), [Renmin University of China](https://en.ruc.edu.cn), majoring in artificial intelligence. I am going to enroll in my PhD program in Renmin University of China this autumn, advised by Prof. [Jiaxin Mao](https://sites.google.com/site/maojiaxin/).

My research interests include information retrieval and nature language processing, with a specific focus on the following areas:

- dense retrieval models,
- large language models for retrieval and ranking,
- and retrieval augmented generation.

# *News*

- ***02.2024***, We trained a ColBERT-style model [`jina-colbert-v1-en`](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-colbert-v1-en) based on our JinaBert which *supports 8k context length* and achieves better performance than ColBERTv2!
- ***01.2024***, Our English-Chinese bilingual embedding model [`jina-embeddings-v2-base-zh`](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-zh) is open sourced on HuggingFace now! (work done during my internship at [Jina AI](https://jina.ai))
